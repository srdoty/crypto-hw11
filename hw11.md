# Homework 11: RSA Implementation

Now that we know how to produce random large primes quickly and easily
(March 24th lecture) we can implement RSA encryption in Python.

### RSA key generation

Let's begin with RSA keys, both public and private. For this we will
need the Miller-Rabin code as well as the extended Euclidean
algorithm. We illustrate a worked example in Python's REPL:

```Python
>>> from MillerRabin import *
>>> from xgcd import *
>>> a = 2**500; b = 2**501 # set upper & lower limits
>>> p = findPrime(a,b)
>>> q = findPrime(a,b)
>>> N = p*q
```

The theory of RSA says that we should pick an exponent $e$ such that
$\gcd(e,\varphi(N)) = 1$, where $\varphi(N) = (p-1)(q-1)$. It is
common, but not required, to pick $e=65537$. Whatever $e$ you pick,
make *sure* that it is relatively prime to $\varphi(N)$. Notice that
$65537$ is a prime number, so it is more likely to be relatively prime
to $\varphi(N)$. Then we need to compute $d = e^{-1}
\pmod{\varphi(N)}$.

```Python
>>> phi = (p-1)*(q-1) # Euler's phi(N)
>>> e = 65537 # a common choice
>>> gcd(e,phi) # check that e is invertible mod phi(N)
1
>>> g,x,y = xgcd(e,phi) # extended EA
>>> d = x % phi # should be the inverse of e mod phi(N)
>>> e*d % phi == 1  # check that it works
True
>>> public_key = (e,N)
>>> private_key = (d,N)
```

In case you are curious, the actual numerical values of the keys
computed above are shown below:

```Python
>>> public_key

```

Note that I inserted line feed breaks in the above numbers in order to make
them fit on one page without overflowing into the margin.

### RSA encryption and decryption

Now that we have our RSA keys, it is trivial to implement RSA
encryption and decryption. Pick any number $x$ less than $N$. This
number represents your plaintext message, or part of it. The RSA
theory says that the corresponding ciphertext is $y = x^e \pmod{N}$.

```Python
>>> x = 12345 # test plaintext message
>>> y = modpower(x,e,N) # corresponding ciphertext
```

Also, RSA decryption is given by $x = y^d \pmod{N}$. Let's test that.

```Python
>>> deciphered = modpower(y,d,N)
>>> deciphered == x  # did it work?
True
```

Notice the use of the stand-alone `modpower` function in both RSA
encryption and decryption. While this is not so important when the
exponent ($e$ for instance) is small, it is absolutely necessary when
the exponent is very large (as $d$ will be here).

### Representation

There is one remaining problem to be solved before we have a complete
system: we need a method of converting arbitrary text into (a sequence
of) integers. We need this because messages are given as strings while
RSA encryption and decryption algorithms operate on integers (residues
less than $N$). Let's agree to call this problem the *representation
problem*. Actually, we face this problem in any public-key cryptosystem.

Given a string of characters, how can we represent it as an integer?
One way is to use Python's builtin `ord` function. If you look this
up, you will see that if `c` is a character in some string then
`ord(c)` returns an integer between 0 and 1114111. Note that here I'm
talking about Python 3, which uses Unicode to encode characters of
strings; Python 2 was different. Anyway, the inverse function of `ord`
in Python is the function `chr`, which accepts as input any integer
between 0 and 1114111 and returns the equivalent character whose
Unicode representation is defined by that number.

Given a string `s` of characters, we can apply the `ord` function to
each character to obtain a list of integers. If $s_k$ is the $k$th
character, then let's set $d_k = \text{ord}(s_k)$. Then we can define
an integer representation of the string $s$ by the rule
$$ \text{rep}(s) = \sum_k  d_k R^k = \sum_k  \text{ord}(s_k) R^k$$
where $R = 1114112$ is the **radix** (number of distinct symbols) of the
Unicode system. Then $\text{rep}(s)$ is an integer representation
of the string $s$.

We can also go backwards, from the integer $z = \text{rep}(s)$
back to the original string $s = \text{unrep}(z)$.
To do that, we apply the division
algorithm (long division) to write $z$ (uniquely) in the form
$$ z = q R + r, \qquad \text{where } 0 \le r < R. $$
Needless to say, $q$ and $r$ are integers. Setting $s_0 = \text{chr}(r)$,
we then have $s = s_0 \Vert \text{unrep}(q)$, where $s =
\text{unrep}(z)$ is the original string and the symbol $\Vert$
is the mathematical symbol for concatenation. This is a recursive
description, but we know how to turn recursion into iteration.

The above considerations lead to the Python code in the file
`represent.py`, which is discussed in greater detail in the
presentation on this topic posted for Tuesday 24th March on Sakai. You
should view that presentation now, if you have not already done
so. What we are doing is *almost* equivalent to expressing $z$ in base
$R$; "almost" because there is an order reversal in the above idea
that is slightly easier to work with in code.

The Unicode system is truly an astounding human accomplishment. It is
a system (actually, several systems) of binary encoding of all the
symbols of all human languages, both past and present! This includes
all of the dead languages that we know about. Read the Wikipedia article on
this fascinating topic if you wish to learn more.

We are still not done with this topic. The problem is that if the
string $s$ is too long, then its representation $\text{rep}(s)$ can be
larger than $N$, the modulus for our RSA system. If that ever happens
then our RSA breaks down, so we have to ensure that
it can never happen. The solution is easy: if $s$ is too long then we
simply break it into blocks of characters each short enough (say of
length $B$) to satisfy the requirement $\text{rep}(s) < N$, and apply
RSA encryption and decryption functions block by block. A little
thought reveals that
$$
\text{the maximum length $B$ of each block is the integer part of $\log_R(N)$}
$$
because we just need to make $R^B < N$, as $\text{rep}(s) < R^B$ if
the length of $s$ is $B$.

The above considerations lead to the code for `replist` and
`unreplist` functions, given in the file
`represent.py`. The function $\text{replist}(s,B)$ accepts a
string $s$ and a blocksize $B$ as inputs and returns a list of integer
representations of the blocks (of length $B$) of the string $s$. The
function $\text{unreplist}(l)$ performs the inverse operation,
turning its input list $l$ back into a string.

```Python
>>> from represent import *
>>> s = "I can't be 100% sure!" # my test string
>>> x = rep(s)
>>> unrep(x)  # should give s back again
"I can't be 100% sure!"
```

If you are curious to see what integer value $x$ has here, you can
simply evaluate to print it, as usual:

```Python
>>> x
2864785916456276893918276164279249573594863140671406456854435715311368912980007
58838537258955941401026636343208963219652681
```

Note that once again I inserted an extra linefeed in the number to
make it possible to display on a printout. We can also, if we desire,
convert our string $s$ into a sequence of integers by using
$\text{replist}(s,B)$ with a chosen blocksize.

```Python
>>> mylist = replist(s,3) # block length 3
>>> mylist
[122883344957513, 48408698945633, 121642099409012, 60821067530341,
45926138773552, 145225857302560, 40961215627378]
>>> unreplist(mylist) # should return the original string
"I can't be 100% sure!"
>>>
>>> mylist = replist(s,2) # block length 2
>>> mylist
[35651657, 108068963, 43450478, 35651700, 112525410, 54591520, 53477424,
35651621, 130351219, 112525426, 33]
>>> unreplist(mylist) 
"I can't be 100% sure!"
```

Notice that the `unreplist` function does not need to know the block
size.

### Summary of RSA implementation

Putting everything together, we get a setup for using RSA to
send and receive messages of arbitrary length, for arbitrary Unicode
strings.  Suppose that Bob wishes to send a secret message to Alice,
whose public RSA key is $(e,N)$. We assume that only Alice knows the
corresponding secret key $d$. Given a string $s$, Bob does the
following:

 1. Compute the blocksize $B = \lfloor \log_R(N) \rfloor$.
 1. Compute $x = \text{replist}(s,B)$.
 2. For each integer in the list $x$, compute the corresponding
 $y = x^e \pmod{N}$. This results
 in a list of integers that we can call $y$. 
 3. Send the list $y$ to Alice.

When Alice receives the list $y$ from Bob, she uses her secret key $d$
corresponding to the public exponent $e$ to compute:

 5. For each integer in the list $y$, compute the corresponding $x =
 y^d \pmod{N}$. Call the resulting list $x$. 
 6. Compute $\text{unreplist}(x)$, which is the original message string $s$.

If Alice desires to send a reply message to Bob, she uses *Bob's public
key* to encrypt it, repeating the above steps 1--4. When Bob receives
her message, he uses steps 5--6 with *his* corresponding secret key to
decrypt the message. 

## Assignment

In a new file, define three Python functions for implementing RSA. At
the top of the file, include import statements to import needed code
from other files as appropriate. The functions should have the
following names and parameters:

```Python
def RSAkeygen(bitsize):
    """returns a triple (e,d,N) defining RSA public and private keys,
    where N = p*q is a product of two random primes of roughly bitsize 
    bits each"""

def RSAencrypt(e,N,s):
    """returns a list y of RSA encrypted integers, where s is a string, 
    using the given keypair (e,N)"""

def RSAdecrypt(d,N,y):
    """returns a string s, where y is a list of RSA encrypted integers, 
    using the given keypair (d,N)"""
```

Test your code by generating RSA keys, and encrypting and then
decrypting various test messages. For example, you might try
encrypting and decrypting the following French text, in which all
the various accents and line feeds should be preserved:

```Python
msg = """
